                                                       Chief Principal's Remarks on
                                                       Our Inaugural Literary Harvest
                                                      Today marks a watershed moment in the
                                                      rich tapestry of Kabarnet High School's
                                                      legacy. As I hold the inaugural issue of
                                                      The Patriarch's School Magazine, I am
                                                      reminded of a farmer who, after months
                                                      of careful cultivation, finally witnesses the

                                                      earth. This magazine represents far more
                                                      than printed pages bound together—it
                                                      is the fertile ground where young minds
                                                      plant their thoughts and watch them
                                                      bloom into profound expression.
                                                      In an age where digital noise often
                                                      drowns authentic voices, this magazine
                                                      stands as an oasis of thoughtful discourse
                                                      and creative expression. This publication
                                                      will carve new pathways for intellectual
                                                      growth and artistic exploration within our

UJUMBE WA MHARIRI MSAIDIZI
            Kichwa: Sauti ya Mwanafunzi, Nguzo ya Maarifa
                     Ndugu wasomaji wetu wapendwa,
            Kwa furaha na heshima tele, napenda kuwaletea
             salamu za dhati kutoka kwa timu ya wahariri wa
           gazeti hili la shule. Kama mhariri msaidizi, nimepata
           nafasi ya kipekee kuwasiliana nanyi kupitia ukurasa
              huu muhimu, ili kuwasilisha ujumbe wetu kwa
                                   pamoja.

            Gazeti hili ni zao la juhudi, ubunifu, na ushirikiano
           kati ya walimu na wanafunzi, likiwa na lengo kuu la
           kuwa jukwaa la maarifa, mawasiliano, burudani, na
            uhamasishaji kwa jamii ya shule yetu. Tunajivunia
             kuwa na jukwaa linalotoa nafasi kwa wanafunzi
             kuonyesha vipaji vyao katika uandishi, ushairi,
                     uchoraji na taaluma nyinginezo.

              Katika toleo hili, utasoma makala mbalimbali
           zenye kuelimisha na kuburudisha. Tutashughulikia
             masuala ya kijamii na kimazingira, mitazamo ya
           wanafunzi kuhusu elimu, pamoja na vipengele vya
            burudani kama vichekesho, methali na mafumbo.

             Kwa hakika, maandalizi ya gazeti hili hayakuwa
            rahisi. Tumekumbana na changamoto mbalimbali
              kama vile uhaba wa vifaa na muda, lakini kwa
                mshikamano na ari ya kutimiza azma yetu,
               tumefanikisha kazi hii kwa wakati. Napenda
           kuwashukuru walimu, wanafunzi, na wote waliotoa
                     mchango wao kwa njia yoyote ile.

            Kwa wanafunzi wenzangu, ningependa kuwasihi
           mpenzi msomeji: usisite kuchangia kazi zako katika
           matoleo yajayo. Gazeti hili ni letu sote, na kila sauti
            ina thamani. Andika, shiriki, na uonyeshe dunia
                             uwezo wako.

             Tukumbuke, elimu si tu darasani, bali pia katika
               kujieleza, kushiriki na kujifunza kutoka kwa
             wengine. Gazeti letu ni sehemu ya safari hiyo.

                       Nawatakia usomaji mwema!

         GIDEON CHESIRE:
KEEPING THE SCHOOL RUNNING SMOOTHLY
                      Gideon Chesire works as the school
                      bursar, and he’s one of the key people
                      behind the smooth running of the school.
                      He handles all financial matters—keeping
                      track of how money is spent, helping
                      with budgeting, and making sure the
                      accounts are audited and up to date.

                      But Gideon does more than just crunch
                      numbers. He works closely with the school
                      administration, especially when it comes to
                      helping students. He helps find bursaries and
                      financial support for those in need, making
                      sure no one is left behind due to lack of fees.

                      He also supports student management and
                      school planning, making him a valuable all-
                      round team player. His work keeps both the
                      books and the students in good shape!

The Mathematics Department is one of the biggest departments in Kabarnet High School. With the
teachers working together with students, concepts are mastered easily. Mathematics is a key subject and
both students and teachers are cognizant of this fact. For this reason, Kabarnet High School ensures there
is sufficient revision and maximum exposure to problems that need solving.
Negative attitudes from learners cripple the
department at times but this will soon be a
thing of the past. We believe in practice that
makes perfect.

                                                  BOOKS AND FUN!
                                                  Entertainment Captain –
                                                 One of the primary purposes of including
                                               entertainment in the school program is to
                                               provide students with a break from the monotony
                                               of their academic studies. This can help prevent
                                              students from getting burnt out and make the
                                              learning environment more enjoyable.
                                             The management, under the guidance of the
                                             principal, has installed sound systems to enhance
                                             the audio quality during entertainment activities.
                                            This can contribute to a better overall experience
                                            for students during events like performances,
                                            presentations, or gatherings.
                                            Allowing students to watch matches outside the
                                           regular school program is a form of entertainment.
                                           This can promote a sense of community and school
                                           spirit and provide an opportunity for students to
                                           relax and enjoy themselves.
                                           The well-known saying, "All work and no play makes
                                           Jack a dull boy," highlights the significance of a
                                          balanced approach to education. Entertainment can
                                          contribute to students' overall well-being and help
                                          them remain motivated and engaged in their studies.
                                          Incorporating entertainment into the school program
                                          is not only about leisure but also about fostering a
                                         well-rounded educational experience that takes into
                                         account the social and emotional development of
                                         students. It can contribute to a more holistic and
                                         enriched learning environment.

EXECUTIVE/ STUDENT COUNCIL




                  ACADEMIC
     Greetings to all. My department is advancing well. In our previous kcse
     results we had a mean point of 7.99 where 273 students went to university
     out of 318. This year are aiming for 100% transition with a mean point of 9.5.
     the students are burning the midnight to post the best results. Teachers are
     putting extraordinary efforts to ensure they extract the best from students
     as far as I am concerned I have ensured the school academic programs
     are running well. We have been having joint exams with other schools like
     kapropita girls and kapsabet boys. I have confirmed that all students have
     a scope to become successful, it depends on how you utilize your time. We
     should all aspire to be go-getters to become academic giants.
     Together everyone achieves more (proverbs 12:11)
